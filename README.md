# hello-world
First repository, made in practice from the Hello World tutorial given by GitHib.


This branch will be edited after the master branch was edited,
meaning this is still an edit of the original.
There should be a collision, then. (this was the branch copy edit, then merged after the master was edited)
=======
Branch (likely the amster) name at top with the description just below.
I like to code and solve puzzles. (this was the first edit to the master branch)
